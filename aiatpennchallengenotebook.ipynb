The data challenge is designed to understand your thought process when working with a data/ML oriented problem. You are given data on listings from Airbnb (found here: https://www.kaggle.com/kritikseth/us-airbnb-open-data) and your task is to create a 3-5 page presentation (to be submitted as a PDF) outlining your findings, analysis, and any recommendations. \nThe topic and structure of your analysis is fully up to you. Potential areas for investigation are as follows: \n1. Build a model to predict the price of an Airbnb listing \na. How accurate is your model? What characteristics drive a higher price? \n2. Give a deeper insight into Airbnb listings \na. Exploratory analysis to understand the mix and characteristics of Airbnb listings \n\nOnce you have completed the challenge, please submit your code and presentation on the application form. This challenge is due along with the application on 12th February 2021.\n\n"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Introduction\n\nWith the given instructions, I will be working toward a mix of suggested areas of investigation 1 & 2, where I will attempt to identify features which have a stronger influence on Price than others (using some exploratory analysis), and use these features to build a model to predict price.
